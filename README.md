# OSM 15 Puzzle (with OpenWhateverMap)

This is a fork of https://github.com/seav/osm-15-puzzle in which the style of each tile is randomly selected as in [OpenWhateverMap](https://github.com/Zverik/openwhatevermap)

---

This is a very simple web app that implements the classic [15 puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) sliding pieces game but using standard [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) tiles as the sliding pieces. Users can choose from among 20 map locations ranging from the whole world down to St. Peterâ€™s Basilica in the Vatican City.
